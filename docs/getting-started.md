# Getting Started

## Installation
To install `nestor`, utilize a python installation (preferably an environment like `pyenv` or `conda`) to install from the PyPi repository:

```bash
pip install nist-nestor
```

This will install `nestor` and its relevant dependencies to the activated environment. 
Instructions for installing [one of the frontend](gui-links.md#graphical-gui) Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) can be found on those pages, individually, since they are maintained as separate packages. 

## Quick-Start


The core `nestor` module is intended to assist analysts (and the UIs or pipelines the may create) in annotating technical text. If you just want to jump in to a more polished experience, head over to the [User Interfaces](gui-links.md) page.
